Utilities for data-oriented programming. What is data-oriented programming? It's kind of like minimum viable functional programming.

- Separate data and functions.
- Use ordinary functions. Avoid methods.
- Use ordinary data types (arrays, objects). Avoid classes.
- Prefer immutability. Avoid state mutation.

dop provides lightweight utilities for:

- Function composition
- Functional polymorphism
- Deep getters/setters with immutability and structural sharing
- Data validation
- "Optionals" using nullish values
